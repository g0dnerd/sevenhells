# Defend the Seven Hells

## Concept
"Defend the Seven Hells" is a tower defense game in which you try to defend the seven hells from humanity. The hells are the last place humans have not settled yet and we want to keep it that way.  
Each round, you get to place 7 gems and keep one of them.  
Each gem you did not keep for the round turns into a wall, so try to build a maze.  
You can combine three or more gems into special gems with cool abilites.  

### The different gems that are available are:
* White (Diamond): ...
* Yellow (Topaz): ...
* Red (Ruby): ...
* Pink (Amethyst): ...
* Blue (Sapphire): ...
* Cyan (Aquamarine): ...
* Black (Opal): ...  
### Gems can have 7 different rarities:
* Glowing (Primitive)
* Fiery (Common)
* Infernal (Uncommon)
* Hellforged (Rare)
* Demonic (Epic)
* Abyssal (Legendary)
* Diabolical (Mythic)  
  
## TODOs
* build pathfinding logic (phaser3 built-in?)
* let player place turrets
* let turrets shoot things
* generate embers for kills
* introduce rarity system
